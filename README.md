# NextUp

## Overview
NextUp is a lightweight addon that brings the current ability suggested by Blizzard's Assisted Highlight feature front and center to your view (or wherever you wish it to be).

For those who like a more trimmed down UI, NextUp can optionally hide action bars.

Note: This addon is currently only compatible with Midnight Beta and is still in active development. A non-beta version will be released when the Midnight expansion is also released.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Installation via an addon manager is recommended. However, you may install directly by downloading the latest release and extracting the ZIP file's contents into WoW's Interface/Addons folder.

[**CurseForge**](https://www.curseforge.com/download), [**WowUp**](https://wowup.io/)

### Setup
Just install and you're good to go. If Blizzard's Assisted Highlight feature is not enabled, you'll be prompted to turn it on.

## Configuration
Access some settings for look and feel under Options->Addons.
