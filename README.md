# NextUp

## Overview
NextUp is a lightweight addon that makes Blizzard's Assisted Highlight feature less clunky to use. Rather than requiring you to search your action bars for the next suggested ability, it's displayed right where you want it.

This addon aims to be Midnight ready by only customizing the look and feel of an existing in-game feature rather than tapping into the combat log.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Installation via an addon manager is recommended. However, you may install directly by downloading the latest release and extracting the ZIP file's contents into WoW's Interface/Addons folder.

[**CurseForge**](https://www.curseforge.com/download), [**WowUp**](https://wowup.io/)

### Setup
Just install and you're good to go. If WoW's Assisted Highlight feature is not enabled, you'll be prompted to turn it on.

## Configuration
Options for look and feel. Optionally hide action bars to declutter the interface. More options on the way!
